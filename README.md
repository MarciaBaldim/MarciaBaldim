## 👋Hello, I'm Marcia

I began my professional journey at the age of 18 at IBGE, working with statistics and data analysis. Two years later, I joined the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Corporation (Correios), where I built a 13-year career as a manager, analyst, and commercial consultant. I then paused my career to dedicate myself to motherhood—a rewarding and enriching 12-year period.

Now, I return to the job market with enthusiasm, ready to combine my experience with a strong desire to contribute.
I am determined to add value and achieve outstanding results.
